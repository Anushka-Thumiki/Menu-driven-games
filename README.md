# Menu-driven-games

This project is based on a program that is menu-driven games in Python. It is user-friendly in that the user gets to choose a game he/she wishes to play from the following:
1. Random number guessing - In this game, the computer will
generate a random number between 1 and 20 and the user will
have to guess the number, based on the hints given.
2. Pi value game - The user can input a number and the number
of decimal places in the value of PI will be displayed based on the
userâ€™s input.
3. Quiz - In this game, there are 10 questions. The user can enter
the option (A, B or C) and for each correct answer 10 points will
be awarded and for each wrong answer, there will be a loss of 5
points.

Concepts like break, continue, if statement, else, for, while, import module (randrange) have been used in the codes.
The Source code pdf contains the entire working code of the program, and the Screenshots pdf contains the output of the program.
